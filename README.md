# Comparative-Analysis-of-Energy-Consumption-in-Python-Java-C-C-and-JavaScript

The Scope of this research is limited to studying and investigating the energy efficiency of the top five most popular programming 
languages used in software development according to the IEEESpectrum website: (Python, Java, C, C++,
and JavaScript) by comparing their energy consumption when 
solving four different computational problems as follows:

- An iteration program to print “Hello World” one million times using for loop.
- A Recursion program to add numbers from 1 to 100. The recursion task is iterated one million 
times. 
- N-body Program from TCLBG*: This program performs mathematical calculations to predict the 
position and velocity of N-body in a group of objects interacting with each other’s gravitationally
using given execution instructions on the website. 
- Fannkuch-redux Program from TCLBG*: This program reverses and reorders a sequence of 
numbers in the range from 1 to 12, accessing their indices, and then outputs the number of flips 
needed to make the first element in the sequence 1.
